{\bf Abstract.}
 We study the stability of the  Logaritmic Sobolev inequality  
with respect to Gauss measure.
More precisely we obtain estimates of the difference between left and  
right hand side of the inequality in terms of a distance from the set  
of functions that give equality in the Logaritmic Sobolev inequality.
A first result employs a distance introduced  by Bucur-Fragal\'{a}, a  
second one is based  on Fourier analysis   and gives an estimate in  
terms of an $L^1$-distance. (This is joint work with F. Feo F., E. Indrei and C. Roberto.)
