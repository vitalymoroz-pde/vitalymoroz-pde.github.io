{\bf Abstract.} 
Many isoperimetric inequalities such as the Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn
inequality generalize to problems with Robin boundary conditions
provided the elasticity constant is positive. The method of domain
variations indicates that this is not anymore true for negative elasticity constants.
This talk will focus on  local results and some attempts to derive global
inequalities. It is based on a project in collaboration with Alfred Wagner
on domain variations.
