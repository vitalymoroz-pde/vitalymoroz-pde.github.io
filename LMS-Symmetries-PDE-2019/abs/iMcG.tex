{\bf Abstract.} A Delauney surface is a surface of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant mean curvature. We give an existence criterion involving elliptic integrals for Delauney surfaces suspended between concentric spheres with radii $r$ and $R$ and tangential boundary conditions. This problem is related to the Bj\"orling problem for CMC surfaces. We give examples of existence and non-existence depending upon the ratio $r/R$. We discuss some associated curvature inequalities. A motivation for the study is to provide an alternative approach to obtaining isoperimetric inequalities with a log-convex density. We hope to touch on this connection briefly.
