{\bf Abstract.} A classical problem for the two-dimensional Euler  flow for an incompressible 
fluid confined to a smooth domain is that of finding regular solutions with highly concentrated vorticities around $N$ moving vortices. The formal dynamic
law for such objects was first derived in the $19$th century by Kirkhoff and Routh. We devise a gluing approach for
the construction of smooth $N$-vortex solutions. We capture in high precision the core of each vortex as a scaled finite
mass solution of Liouville's equation plus small, more regular terms.
