The subject of this talk is the 
following quantitative isoperimetric inequality
in the plane
$$
[\lambda_0(\Omega)]^2\leq C \delta(\Omega)\,,
\,\,\,\,\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2\,,
$$
where $\delta$ is the isoperimetric deficit 
and $\lambda_0$ is the barycentric asymmetry introduced by Fuglede in 1993. The latter quantity measures the symmetric difference between $\Omega$ and the ball of same measure centered in the barycenter of $\Omega$.
