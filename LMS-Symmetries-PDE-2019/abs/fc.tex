{\bf Abstract.}
We will discuss the isoperimetric problem for factorized 
measures obtained as perturbations of the gaussian and the 
antigaussian, respectively. Some applications, like, for instance, 
Faber-Krahn type inequalities will be also presented. (Joint works 
with F. Brock and A. Mercaldo)
