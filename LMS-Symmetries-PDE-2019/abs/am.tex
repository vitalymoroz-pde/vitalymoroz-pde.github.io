{\bf Abstract.}
In this talk a class of isoperimetric problems on $\mathbb{R}^2_+ $ with respect to monomial weights  is presented.  
Let $\alpha $ and $\beta $ be real numbers that satisfy certain conditions. 
We show that,  among all smooth sets $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R} ^2_+$ with fixed weighted measure $\int\!\!\int_{\Omega } y^{\beta} dxdy$, the weighted perimeter $\int_{\partial \Omega } y^\alpha \, ds$ achieves its minimum for a smooth set which is symmetric w.r.t. to the $y$--axis, and is explicitly given. Our results also imply an estimate of a weighted Cheeger constant and a sharp bound for eigenvalues of some nonlinear problems.

\noindent The results are joint work with A. Alvino, F. Brock, F. Chiacchio, A. Mercaldo and M.R. Posteraro.
