\begin{abstract}
In the past few years, methods based on nonlinear evolutionary
partial differential equations has become increasingly popular
in the image processing and computer graphics fields. PDE-based
techniques have brought new and powerful tools in imaging and
graphics, the areas traditionally occupied by electrical engineers
and computer scientists. In their turn, image processing and computer
graphics bring to the PDE field many new and challenging problems.

In my talk, I will give a brief and informal overview of nonlinear
diffusion techniques used for image denoising, enhancement, and
segmentation. I will also discuss classical and recent applications
of nonlinear diffusion tools in computer graphics and geometry
processing areas. In particular, the following topics will be
covered:


-- Perona-Malik nonlinear diffusion and its extensions;

-- Curvature-driven curve and surface evolutions for object
     boundary detection and adaptive smoothing;
     
-- Bilateral filter and its generalizations.
