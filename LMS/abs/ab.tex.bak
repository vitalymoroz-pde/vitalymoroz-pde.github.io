\begin{abstract}
An existence theory for local solutions of a parabolic problem
under a dynamical boundary condition $\sigma u_t+u_n=0$ is developed and a
spectral representation formula is derived. It relies on the spectral theory
of an associated elliptic
problem with the eigenvalue parameter both in the equation and the boundary
condition. The well--posedness of the parabolic problem holds in some natural
space only if the number of negative
eigenvalues is finite. This depends on the parameter $\sigma$ in
the boundary condition. If $\sigma\geq 0$ the parabolic problem is always
well-posed. For $\sigma<0$ it is well-posed only if the space dimension is $1$
and ill-posed in space dimension $\geq 2$. By means of the theory of compact
operators the spectrum is analyzed and some qualitative properties of the
eigenfunctions are derived. An interesting phenomenon
is the ``parameter-resonance'', where for a specific parameter-value
$\sigma_0$ two eigenvalues of the elliptic problem cross. Depending on the time
some qualitative properties will be discussed.
