<b>John Toland</b> (Bath, UK) <br>
<em><a href="abs/jt.pdf">Waves with prescribed distribution of vorticity</a></em>
<p>
<em>Abstract.</em> 
This concerns a variational theory of steady periodic surface waves in which 
the distribution function of vorticity (its rearrangement class) in the underlying flow is prescribed. 
Waves arise from minimizing the total energy and the functional dependence of vorticity 
on the stream function emerges as the Lagrange multiplier that comes from prescribing the vorticity distribution. 
The theory does not distinguish between irrotational waves and waves with locally square-integrable vorticity.

<em><a href="abs/vf.pdf">Monotonicity methods for asymptotics of solutions to elliptic and
parabolic equations near singularities of the potential</a></em>
<p>
<em>Abstract.</em>
The effect of singularities on profile of solutions to partial
differential equations of elliptic and parabolic type will be
discussed, mainly focusing on singularities generated by homogeneous
potentials which, having the same order of homogeneity as the
differential operator, make it invariant by scaling and can therefore
be regarded as "critical" from the mathematical point of view. Local
asymptotics of solutions will be investigated  by a monotonicity
method based on Almgren type formulas combined with blow-up methods
and separation of variables; the strength of such methodology  relies
in the use of monotonicity to prove not only unique continuation but
also precise asymptotics of  solutions, by extracting such precious
information from the behavior of the quotient associated with the
Lagrangian energy and providing a unified approach for linear and
nonlinear equations.

<b>Jean Dolbeault</b> (CEREMADE Paris, France) <br>
<em><a href="abs/jd.pdf">Existence, symmetry and symmetry breaking for extremal functions of some interpolation functional inequalities</a></em>
<p>
<em>Abstract.</em> I will present a review of some recent results on existence, symmetry and symmetry breaking of optimal
functions for Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (CKN) and weighted logarithmic Hardy (WLH) inequalities.
These results have been obtained in a series of papers in collaboration with M. del Pino, M.J. Esteban, S. Filippas, M. Loss, G. Tarantello and A. Tertikas. The
highlights will be put on a symmetry breaking result: extremals of some inequalities are not radially symmetric in regions where the
symmetric extremals are linearly stable. Special attention is paid to the study of the critical cases for (CKN) and (WLH).

<em><a href="abs/gqc.pdf">Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations of Mixed Elliptic-Hyperbolic Type</a></em>
<p>
<em>Abstract.</em>
Many nonlinear partial differential equations arising in
mechanics and geometry naturally are of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type.
The solution of some fundamental issues in these areas greatly
requires a deep understanding of such nonlinear partial differential
equations of mixed type. Important examples include transonic flow
equations in fluid mechanics and the Gauss-Codazzi system for
isometric embedding in differential geometry.
In this talk we will discuss some recent developments in the analysis
of nonlinear partial differential equations of mixed type through these
examples with emphasis on identifying/developing mathematical
approaches, ideas, and techniques to deal with the mixed-type
problems. Further trends, perspectives, and open problems in this
direction will also be addressed.
