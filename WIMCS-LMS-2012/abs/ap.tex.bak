\noindent
{\bf Abstract.}
I will explain some results concerning the existence of
continuous vector fields in the Euclidean space of dimension \(N\) when
the divergence is prescribed. Up to an \(L^1\) perturbation of the data,
this is always the case if the divergence does not charge sets of finite
Hausdorff measure of dimension \(N-1\).
