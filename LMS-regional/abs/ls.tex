\begin{abstract}
In the talk we discuss parallels between the Nash-Kuiper theory of isometric embeddings and the weak solutions of the Euler equations of ideal incompressible flows, that were constructed by Scheffer and Shnirelman. In particular the latter, when interpreted in the framework of the former, can be largely simplified and extended.
