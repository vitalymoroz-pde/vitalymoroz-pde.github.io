\begin{abstract}
Over the last decade, the construction of (absolute) minimizers  of non(semi)convex  problems developed rapidly.
Since the direct method fails here, various techniques for
partial differential inclusions have to be used - usually
giving highly oscillatory gradients of the lipschitz solutions.

\smallskip We rather search for minimizers, whose gradient is almost
everywhere locally constant, and give first examples of this
kind for a three dimensional rotational invariant case.
