{\bf Abstract.}
Non–negative weak solutions of quasilinear degenerate parabolic equationsof $p$--Laplacian type are shown to be locally bounded below by Barenblatttype sub–potentials. As a consequence non–negative solutions expandtheir positivity set. That is, a quantitative lower bound on a ball$B_\rho$ at time $\bar{t}$ yields a quantitative lower bound on a ball $B_{2\rho}$ at somefurther time $t$. These lower bounds also permit one to recast the Harnackinequality of \cite{4} in a family of alternative, equivalent forms.
