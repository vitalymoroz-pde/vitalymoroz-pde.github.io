\begin{abstract}
One of remarkable properties of nonlinear evolution problems is the
possibility of eventual occurrence of singularities starting from
perfectly smooth initial data. The simplest form of spontaneous
singularities, a blow-up phenomenon, appears when solutions cease to
exist globally in time because of infinite growth of one of the
variables describing the evolution process.
The talk will discuss main questions raised in the study of blow-up for
several parabolic problems. For example, what is the rate of blowup, and
how  to describe possible space-time profiles of blowing up solutions.\\
