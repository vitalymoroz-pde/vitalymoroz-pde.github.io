<p><big><b>How to install and start MATHEMATICA for the first time</b></big>

<p>
To install MATHEMATICA for the first time, locate it under <em>Applications</em> tab
within <em>Novell delivered Applications</em><br> and double click on the MATHEMATICA icon:

<p>
After the installation process is completed (this could take some time),<br> 
you will be able to find MATHEMATICA under the usual Windows Start Menu:


<p>

<p>
Click on the <b>Mathematica 6</b> icon (not on the Mathematica kernel!)<br> 
and you will have MATHEMATICA up and running:

<p> 
It is a good idea to start working by running <b>First five minutes with Mathematica</b>
tutorial<br> which you will find under Mathematica <b>Startup palette</b>.

<p>
After you finished with the tutorial, start working with you own notebook,<br>
which is usually called <em>Untitled-1.nb</em> (but you could rename it at any time).

<p>

<p>
First, by moving mouse over the notebook make sure that the cursor looks horizontal.
<br>
Then press <em>Enter</em> on the computer keyboard. This will create a new empty <em>cell</em>.
<br>
<p>
Make sure the cursor is inside the cell and looks vertical:

<p>
Now start typing using the keyboard and then press <em>Shift</em> and <em>Enter</em> 
<br> on the keyboard simultaneously.
This will execute the instruction:

<p>
This is your first result with MATHEMATICA!

<p>
Continue working, and always consult <b>Documentation Center</b>
which could be started from the <em>Help</em> menu:

<p>
Documentation Center window looks like this:

<p>
Do not forget to save your notebook after you finish. This could be done from
MATHEMATICA <br> <em>File</em> menu in the same way as with any other Windows programm.

<p>
It is a good idea to include your student number in the name of the file<br>
if you ever plan to submit this file as an assignment.

Good luck!
