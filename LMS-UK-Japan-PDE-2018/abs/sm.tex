{\bf Abstract.}
It is known that, in several nonlinear dispersive equations, a solution corresponds to a small initial data behaves
like a free solution near time infinity. The behavior is called scattering. On the other hand, some of them also admit
non-scattering, hence relatively large, solutions, such as solitons.
In this talk, I will introduce two minimization problems on non-scattering solutions in order to find a threshold solution
which lies on the ``boundary" of two kinds of solutions. We discuss existence of minimizers, and properties of them.
The proof is based on a concentration compactness/rigidity type argument by Kenig-Merle. We heavily rely on the
profile decomposition technique associated with the Strichartz estimates.
